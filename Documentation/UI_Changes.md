## Rationale for UI Changes

These UI changes collectively accomplish several key goals:

1. **Simplification**: By removing unnecessary navigation elements and buttons, we reduce visual clutter and cognitive load.

2. **Focus**: The centered single CTA on the landing page and clear filters on the hackathon list create a focused user journey.

3. **Consistency**: Centralized routing and consistent styling across components improve the overall user experience.

4. **Visual Hierarchy**: Better alignment and spacing help guide the user's attention to the most important elements.

5. **Mobile Responsiveness**: All changes maintain or improve the responsive design for various screen sizes.

The application's primary navigation now relies on:

- The "Hackathon Events" button for direct access to hackathon listings
- The sidebar for authenticated users to navigate between sections
- Breadcrumbs for sub-navigation within hackathon details
- Back buttons for returning to previous screens

All routing is centralized in the `FrontendWeb/app/_lib/routes.ts` file to maintain consistency across the application. Hackathon Events
